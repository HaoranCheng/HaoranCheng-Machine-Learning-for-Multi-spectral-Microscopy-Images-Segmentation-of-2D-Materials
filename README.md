# Machine-Learning-for-Multi-spectral-Microscopy-Images-Segmentation-of-2D-Materials
Introduction
This is the repo of for Deep-Learning-Based Autofocusing of Bright-Field Microscopic Imagery. The framework of the codes is modified from PyTorch-GAN by eriklindernoren (Pix2Pix part). The codes are developed by Yucheng Zhang(Email:yucheng.zhang009@gmail.com). This work is the co-work of Mr. Xingchen Dong(E-Mail:xingchen.dong@tum.de).
